# Beast Vault

A local-first **Beast Vault** to import, store, compare, and browse Pok√©mon data from `.pk*` files across all game generations (Gen 1 ‚Üí Gen 9, plus supported spin-offs).

This tool works only with legitimately obtained backup files and is **not an official Pok√©mon product**. All Pok√©mon references are for descriptive purposes only and are trademarks of their respective owners.

Uses **PKHeX.Core** for parsing and name resolution, **SQLite** for storage, and exposes a clean **REST API**.

A companion React/TypeScript UI is available at [BeastVault.Front](https://github.com/David-H-Afonso/BeastVault.Front) to be used with an UI.

## TL;DR

- **Import** one or many `.pk*` files (e.g., `.pk9`) and keep the **original file** (unmodified, for full fidelity).
- **Store** full metadata locally (species, forms, OT/TID/SID, IV/EV, moves, ball, language, origin, Tera Type, ribbons, marks, etc.).
- **Compare** any two Pok√©mon and see all differences (e.g., after trading or editing).
- **Export** a **Pok√©mon Showdown** set (with names from PKHeX.Core).
- **Stack:** .NET 9 + ASP.NET Core + EF Core + SQLite + PKHeX.Core + Swagger.
- **Status:** Full PK9 support, PKHeX.Core GameStrings migration, original file preservation, Pok√©mon comparison endpoint, and clean codebase (no custom enums).

**Data Storage Location:**
The application uses two separate directories for optimal security and usability:

**Private Data (Hidden from user):**

- **Database:** `%LocalAppData%\BeastVault\storage\beastvault.db`

**Public Data (User accessible):**

- **Pokemon Files:** `%UserProfile%\Documents\BeastVault\`

**üìÅ Automatic File Detection:**
The application automatically monitors the Documents folder and:

- Scans for new Pokemon files on startup
- Supports drag-and-drop workflow (just copy files to Documents/BeastVault)
- Automatically imports new files and skips duplicates
- Works with subdirectories

**Supported file formats:**

- `.pk1`, `.pk2`, `.pk3`, `.pk4`, `.pk5`, `.pk6`, `.pk7`, `.pk8`, `.pk9`
- `.pb7`, `.pb8` (Pokemon Box files)
- `.ek1` - `.ek9` (Encrypted files)
- `.ekx` (Encrypted batch)

This ensures:

- Database is secure and hidden from casual user access
- Pokemon files are easily accessible for backup/sharing
- Clean separation between application data and user data
- Multiple users can run the application independently
- "Dump" folder functionality for easy file management

You can override these paths in `appsettings.json` if needed:

```json
{
  "Vault": {
    "BasePath": "C:\\CustomPath\\backup"
  },
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "Default": "Data Source=C:\\CustomPath\\beastvault.db"
  }
}
```

- `Contracts/`: DTOs for API requests/responses.
- `Domain/`: Core entities for Pok√©mon, stats, moves, etc.
- `Endpoints/`: Minimal API endpoints (import, get, compare, health).
- `Infrastructure/Services/`: Business logic, file storage, PKHeX integration, helpers (including name resolution and comparison).
- `ReferenceData/`: **Removed**. All enums and static data now use PKHeX.Core GameStrings.

## Tech stack

- **Backend:**

  - .NET 9
  - ASP.NET Core Minimal API
  - Entity Framework Core
  - SQLite (local storage)
  - PKHeX.Core (Pok√©mon parsing, name resolution, GameStrings)
  - Swashbuckle / Swagger UI

- **Other:**
  - Dependency Injection
  - HealthChecks
  - Modular endpoint & service structure
  - Multi-generation compatibility
  - Original file preservation (vault)
  - Pok√©mon comparison tooling

---

## Goals

### General

Create a **personal Beast Vault** that:

- Imports Pok√©mon from `.pk*` files obtained legally.
- Displays detailed information in a user-friendly format.
- Keeps a secure local record of the collection (including original files).

### Technical

- Full compatibility with `.pk*` from Gen 1 to Gen 9 + supported spin-offs.
- Local storage of Pok√©mon data, metadata & original file (unmodified).
- Advanced parsing and name resolution with PKHeX.Core (no custom enums).
- Showdown export (with accurate names).
- Pok√©mon comparison endpoint for difference analysis.
- Modular architecture for future UI integration.
- REST API with Swagger documentation.

---

## Current progress

- Full PK9 support: All fields parsed and stored, including new Gen 9 data.
- PKHeX.Core GameStrings: All names (species, moves, items, etc.) resolved via PKHeX.Core, no custom enums.
- Original file preservation: Every import stores the unmodified file in the vault.
- Pok√©mon comparison: `/pokemon/compare/{id1}/{id2}` endpoint to analyze all differences between two Pok√©mon (e.g., after trading or editing).
- Showdown export: `/pokemon/{id}/showdown` (GET) returns a Showdown set with accurate names.
- Clean codebase: ReferenceData and all custom enums removed.
- Minimal API endpoints: Import, get, compare, health.
- Swagger UI for testing & docs.
- Launch profiles for HTTP + HTTPS.

---

## Next steps

- [ ] Support ribbons, marks, contest stats (in progress).
- [ ] Return sprites/images in API responses.
- [ ] Implement advanced filtering/search.
- [ ] Build React/TypeScript UI.
